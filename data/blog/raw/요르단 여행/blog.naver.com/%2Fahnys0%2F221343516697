퀸 알리아 국제공항의
새로운 여객 터미널 빌딩 디자인은 이 지역의 지형과 전통에 따라 설계되었습니다. 터미널 빌딩의 구조는 사막 야자 잎과 닮았으며, 일련의 돔이 그들을 지지하는 기둥에서 튀어 나오고 있습니다. 이 지역의 여름 더위는 가혹하며, 터미널은 열에 대한 절연을 지원하는 콘크리트로 주로 구성되어 있습니다.
​
터미널 건물의 모든면에는 항공기가 승객에게 보이도록 유리가 장착되어 있습니다. 파사드는 햇빛에 더 많이 노출되는 부분에 초점을 맞추는 수평 루버에 의해 직사 광선으로부터 차폐됩니다.
forecourt는 또한 나무와 좌석을 포함하는 플라자를 형성하기 위해 확장됩니다. 이 플라자는 승객 단체 및 가족들의 모임을 용이하게합니다.
이 터미널에는 건물의 친환경 기능을 향상시키는 외부 안뜰이 있습니다. 안뜰의 나무는 공기 처리 시스템에 흡수되기 전에 오염된 공기를 정화합니다.

Getting to and from Amman Airport by taxi seems a good mean of transportation, since it is located at just 30 kilometres south of downtown; that means an average transfer time which can vary between 40 and 50 minutes according to the traffic.
Official taxis are yellow (regular taxis) although some of them are white too (service taxis).
Please note that service taxis stand for the taxis which heads to a specific route where you pay a price according to the destination (in that sense, there aren’t fixed fares). This service operates like a bus, since you need to wait until the taxi is filled with all 4 passengers.
Regarding yellow taxis, they operate as a regular taxi, which fares passengers per distance and time.
You may encounter with some other white taxis, not service taxis, which stands for the luxury taxis and furthermore, as they name says, are more expensive.
Scams
We recommend you to agree a price with the taxi driver to avoid an inflated price or a detour during transportation and also make sure that the taximeter is turned on.
In case of not carrying small change, insist to the driver to give back the exact change since many of them will try to scam you. If the driver refuses, threat to call the police.
On the other hand, do not board unofficial taxis since you could be a victim of a scam.
Location
Taxi ranks can be found at the public landside, outside the Arrivals Hall, in the ground level.
Companies
Taxis operate 24 hours a day.
In order to book a taxi, you may call the following numbers:
Tel: +962 6 4451074 / +962 6 4451302
Fares

Note that prices are fixed by law and are posted in the taxi park at the terminals exits.
While booking your trip, you must get a piece of paper, where the price of your trip is set, from the taxi stand controller and give it  to the driver.
Please note that from 9:00 pm prices are higher.
Shared Rides
Shared ride service is available to those who wish to share a ride and pay a flat rate to certain destinations if multiple parties are available for the trip. Apps such as Uber may be useful to do so.
